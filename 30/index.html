  <h2 class="svelte-g3qr3y">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</h2>
  <span>by</span> <b>Martin Klepmann</b>
  
<p>I got this book when I finally came to terms with needing to deal with databases.
It’s an excellent introduction to the concepts you’ll need to know when building an application that needs to handle 1 <abbr title="Tebibyte = 2^40 = 1024^4 bytes">TiB</abbr>+ of data, or any distributed system.
I reference it whenever I forget how a specific kind of index works, which is often.</p>

  <h2 class="svelte-g3qr3y">And the Band Played On</h2>
  <span>by</span> <b>Randy Shilts</b>
  
<blockquote><p>Shilts declined to be told the results of his HIV test until he had completed the writing of And the Band Played On, concerned that the test result, whatever it might be, would interfere with his objectivity as a writer. He was finally found to be HIV positive in March 1987.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Shilts#Illness_and_death" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Shilts#Illness_and_death</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m surprised the author kept himself in the dark. The history is written like a disaster movie, with you watching the catastrophe unfold while discovering the heroes and villains in their otherwise-normal lives.</p>
<p>I’m still (2021) reading this, since it’s effectively a textbook.</p>

  <h2 class="svelte-g3qr3y">Spam Nation</h2>
  <span>by</span> <b>Brian Krebs</b>
  
<p>Not exactly a page-turner, but it had some interesting points:</p>
<ul><li>Americans funded/are funding cybercriminals by buying affordable medicine online, even without a guarantee that the ordered pills are what they say they are</li>
<li>Drug companies effectively blocked research on the quality of the online-ordered medicine in case it really was high-quality</li></ul>
<p>bonus fact: I got this copy for $1 at Second Chance, a store that sells recycled materials from deconstructed houses.</p>

  <h2 class="svelte-g3qr3y">Being Mortal</h2>
  <span>by</span> <b>Atul Gawande</b>
  
<p>If you or anyone you know will eventually die, I’d recommend reading this book.
I hadn’t considered that there might be an art to dying, or that one could die well without e.g. a heroic last stand.
I’m not looking forward to using the advice in this book(1) but I expect the advice will eventually come in useful.</p>
<p>1: summarized: understand what parts of your life you want to prioritize preserving, have a plan, hospice is the way to go.</p>
