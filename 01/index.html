  <h2 class="svelte-g3qr3y">Hard to be a God</h2>
  <span>by</span> <b>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</b>
  
<p>The story follows an anthropologist embedded in a technologically primitive, authoritarian, and definitely human society on another world.
I first read this in December 2016 or early 2017. It didn’t make me feel better, but it did give me better language for thinking about the the ideological grayness that spread in the book and in real life.</p>

  <span>by</span> <b>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</b>
  
<p>R.P. is currently (2016-2021, at least) my favorite science fiction book.
Few other books combine phenomena so alien and characters so human. <a href="../00/#the_dark_forest"><em>The Dark Forest</em></a> is one of the few others that might compete on both fronts.</p>

  <span>by</span> <b>Larry Niven</b>
  
<p>Larry Niven manages to combine the best of SF’s thinking big — solar-system sized engineering, galaxy-sized natural phenomena — with everything being the main character’s girlfriend’s fault. 3/10; just play Halo instead if you want a story that happens on a big space station.</p>

  <span>by</span> <b>Larry Niven</b>
  
<p>The solar system and the mystery around the aliens almost makes this book worth reading — I have a soft spot for settings with alien ruins. However, one of the characters forgets she just escaped from a concentration camp between chapters 1 and 2, so the balance is still negative.</p>
