In our world, there was a proposal around WWII to grant European Jews asylum in Alaska [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Alaska#1940s_%E2%80%93_2000s). In this book, the plan happened. The story follows a hardboiled detective through the Alaskan city on the brink of reverting from a semi-sovereign state into the control of the U.S. You can practically smell the characters.

Also, at the end of the book there's an amazing pun. It's worth reading just for that.
