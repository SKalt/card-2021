A nihilist take on the superheros of the 60s-80s. The spandex-clad blockbusters today tend to forget that while some comics (X-men, She-hulk) were intentionally progressive, others weren't. Hippies and anti-war activists used to be regular punching bags. _Watchmen_ writes superheros that are explicitly a product of their time.
I watched the HBO series; I thought the riff off of the original did the subject matter justice.

I bought a copy because it's physically impossible to hold that much clashing neon in your memory. You don't even need to read it, you can just see the panels across the room.
