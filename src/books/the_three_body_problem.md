A thriller set in China during the Cultural Revolution and the near future.
Even on the second pass, I had to keep turning pages to follow the plot's unexplained physical phenomena to their source.
10/10, I'd definitely recommend this book if you know anything about Chinese history in the 20th-21st century.
