This one captures what it feels like to be fresh out of college and not sure how to navigate the job market.
The youthful optimism has the same spirit of [_The Opposite Of Loneliness_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143905-the-opposite-of-loneliness), an essay with the punchline "don't worry about what happens after college, we've got time to figure it out, also, don't do consulting". The plot is closer to that of [_The Bell Jar_](../21/#the_bell_jar), in which a college-age young woman works at a fashion magazine in New York City and becomes horribly depressed.
